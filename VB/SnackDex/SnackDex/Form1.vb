is an average ranking. And a 5/10 means that it is pretty bad. This leaves the fact that there are only
3 ranking spots for good things. And 6 spots for bad things. Which is honestly pretty unfair for the good things.
I think this has to do with today's grading system. Which a 70%, or a 7/10 is average. Which is pretty fair due
to the fact that humans are number 1 on the big brain scale which was put together by humans. Anyway, I think
people, should adjust the way we see this scale so that the middle, can be seen as the middle of the scale"
